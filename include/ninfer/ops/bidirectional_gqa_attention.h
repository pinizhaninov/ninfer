 * Op: bidirectional grouped-query attention over persistent context and one query block
 *
 * For D=128, Hq=32, Hkv=8, group=4, query row i, query head h, and kvh=floor(h/4):
 *
 *   keys   = context K rows [0,L) followed logically by every query K row [0,T)
 *   score  = scale * dot(q[:,h,i], key[:,kvh,j])
 *   prob   = softmax over the complete logical key set
 *   ideal[:,h,i] = sum_j prob[j] * value[:,kvh,j]
 *
 * q/out are contiguous BF16 [128,32,T]. query_k/query_v are contiguous BF16 [128,8,T].
 * context_length is a contiguous device I32 scalar L. context is a read-only linear BF16 cache
 * with logical shape [128,capacity,8], of which [0,L) is populated. This DFlash companion cache
 * has no scale planes and is independent of the target Text/MTP KV format. scale is 1/sqrt(128).
 *
 * There is no causal triangle: every query row attends every other query K/V row. Context and
 * query K/V remain separate physical segments and every input/cache byte is unchanged. The oracle
 * evaluates `ideal` naively in FP64 from the represented inputs. The BF16 out is promoted and
 * compared directly with that result; output storage rounding belongs to the Op's numerical
 * criterion, not the oracle. out is the only observable mutation and is completely overwritten.
 * The current optimized implementation domain is T=1..16 on sm_120a.
 *
 * The caller guarantees min_context <= L <= max_context and L <= context.max_context. The
 * execution envelope may affect finite launch selection and workspace capacity, never the
 * admitted key set or numerical result.
