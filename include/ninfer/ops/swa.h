 * q/out are contiguous BF16 [128,32,T], query_k/query_v are contiguous BF16 [128,8,T], and
 * positions is contiguous device I32 [T] with positions[i] = L+i.
 *
 * The read-only cyclic context is BF16 with no scale planes and contains committed absolute
 * positions [max(0,L-4096),L), with absolute position p stored at physical slot p mod 4096. Query
 * K/V is a separate temporary segment at positions [L,L+T). For every query position p_i, the
 * admitted populated keys satisfy abs(p_j-p_i)<4096. Thus distance 4095 is included, distance 4096
 * is excluded, and every query row sees every temporary query row. scale is 1/sqrt(128).
 *
 * Context and query K/V are unchanged. out is the only observable mutation and is completely
 * overwritten. The current optimized implementation domain is T=1..16 on sm_120a.
 *
 * The caller guarantees min_context <= L <= max_context, sequential nonnegative positions, and
 * that the cyclic context contains the declared live interval. The execution envelope may affect
 * finite launch selection and workspace capacity, never the admitted key set.
