/**
 * Shared numerical contract for A1/A2/A3.
 *
 * Public q/k/v inputs and BF16 cache values are interpreted after their BF16 storage boundary.
 * The K and V planes select their storage independently: each side is BF16 or INT8-G64, and the
 * two sides may differ (e.g. K BF16 with V INT8-G64). INT8-G64 cache rows use one FP16 scale for
 * each contiguous 64-element group. For BF16 source values x, their exact observable encoding is:
 *
 *   a          = max_i abs(FP32(x[i]))
 *   scale_bits = FP16_RNE(a / 127)
 *   s          = FP32(scale_bits)
 *   inv        = s == 0 ? 0 : FP32(1 / s)
 *   code[i]    = s == 0 ? 0 : I8(clamp(RNE_even(FP32(x[i]) * inv), -127, 127))
 *   decode[i]  = FP32(code[i]) * s
 *
 * A1 and A2 produce identical code and scale bits. The common ideal attention oracle uses BF16 Q
 * and logical cache values (per side: BF16 values for a BF16 plane, FP32 decode above for an
 * INT8-G64 plane), then evaluates score dot products, stable softmax, and value reduction in FP64.
 * The BF16 Op output is promoted to FP64 for comparison with that result.
 *
 * The registered INT8 implementation defines Q8-G64, paired with INT8-G64 K, as its native query
 * compute profile; it applies only when both planes are INT8-G64. Its profile-defined query
 * quantization and any narrower staging do not replace BF16 Q in the ideal oracle. A mixed-format
 * cache keeps BF16 Q/K tensor-core math and dequantizes only the INT8-G64 side. BF16-cache,
 * INT8-cache, and mixed-cache compute profiles therefore have separate named numerical criteria
 * owned by the GQA conformance test. Those envelopes apply to the registered geometries, tested
 * token extents, conformance matrix, and target-representative activation range; they are not a
 * universal error bound for arbitrary adversarial BF16 tensors. A1 and A3 are each qualified
 * directly against the ideal oracle. A1-versus-A3 parity is only an additional consistency check.
